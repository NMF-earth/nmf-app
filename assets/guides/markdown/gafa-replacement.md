# Find replacement for internet giants

Google, Facebook, üçè and any other tech monsters are harvesting data about their users and that's a bad thing for you and the environment.

If something is free, there is a trick, right? The more data these companies have on you, the more valuable you are for them. It allows target ads depending on your age, sex, religion, political opinion etc.

Framasoft a French association is trying to de-google-ify the internet by providing the same services as some of the GAFA but in a ethical and open source way.

Examples :

- [Peertube](https://joinpeertube.org/) alternative to Youtube.
- [Mobilizon](https://joinmobilizon.org/en/) is an alternative to Meetup and Facebook events.
- [FramaTalk](https://framatalk.org/accueil/en/) as a replacement for Zoom/Skype
- [Framagenda](https://framagenda.org): creating public or private calendars
