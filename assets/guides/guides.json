[{"title":"Avoid streaming","category":"digital","body":"<h1>Avoid streaming</h1>\n<p>Streaming is nice, streaming is amazing, but have you ever though about the consequences on the environement?</p>\n<p>To give you an idea on how bad the streaming is, let's take an example. The size of the article text in the English Wikipedia is around <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_of_Wikipedia\">20 gigabytes</a> of data in 2020. It means that everytime you watch a season of the Walking Dead in HD (1080p), you have downloaded on your computer/phone the same amount of data as the entire Wikipedia encyclopedia.</p>\n<p>Same applies to Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon and Youtube. Music is much smaller than a HD video but an average user consumes several songs in a day so at the end of the year, the impact of the climate is not negligeable.</p>\n<p>Both music and video streaming relies on servers as well as internet infrastuctures to transport the data to you. All of this has a cost, so instead of streaming in all circomstances, try to listen to the radio, go the cinema.... Who knows, you might end up meeting real people in real life!</p>\n<p>Don't forget to cancel autoplay by default, leading to unecessary streaming like Youtube is doing. In most video streaming platform, you can save this behavior in the preferences. If you can, use Peertube, a decentralized and open-source video platform, much better for the environement compared to Youtube and more ethical.</p>\n<p>If you still want to use YouTube, we recomment <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-focus/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=search\">Youtube Focus</a>, an add-on who tries to promote a healthier watching. As said on their <a href=\"https://github.com/Jompa14/YouTube_Focus\">Github</a>, YouTube has one billion hours whatched daily, and it’s recommendation algorithm generates more than 70% of views. That means 700.000.000 hours every single day. What means that the greatest slice of time that people spend on YouTube isnt because they searched for something to whatch or something to learn, it is because they were sugested by YouTube's algorithm.</p>\n","key":".//markdown/avoid-streaming.md"},{"title":"Install an add blocker","category":"digital","body":"<h1>Install an add blocker</h1>\n<p>All modern browser like Firefox, Safari, Chrome... let users the posibility to install add-ons, also name plugins or extensions.</p>\n<p>In order to not get ads or to see less ads, you can install the following browser extensions :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/da/firefox/addon/ghostery/\">Ghostery</a>: built-in ad blocker removing advertisements from a web page to eliminate clutter so you can focus on the content you want.

But eating tomatoes during the whole year is not sustainable. During winter, we eat imported tomatoes or cultivated in greenhouses. And that’s a pity : tomatoes are more juicy and tasteful during summer. Respecting nature by eating seasonal fruit and vegetables can be a very interesting challenge to make you discover new ingredients such as black radish, lotus root or winter melon.</p>\n<h3>Fun fact : cheese are also seasonal.</h3>\n<h1>Eating locally</h1>\n<p>You’re already eating less meat or you’re already vegetarian? Great! Next step, you can become a locavore, which means that the food you're eating is limited from an area of 50 to 200 kilometers. Of course, it’s easier to eat locally when you leaving in the countryside than in a big town. But it is still possible !</p>\n","key":".//markdown/eat-seasonal-and-local.md"},{"title":"Clean your cloud data","category":"digital","body":"<h1>Clean your cloud data</h1>\n<p>When your data is saved on the cloud, it means it's saved on remote computers (servers). It's really nice and convenient because if you loose your computer or your phone, your data is not lost!</p>\n<p>However, redundant data is not environmental friendly at all and will never be. Remember this: everytime you save data, transfer data it means CO2 emissions.</p>\n<p>Servers as well as your devices needs many rare metals but also because it needs electricity to work. For the servers, it's every single day of the year with no down time, to make sure you can access your data at any time of the day. As you know, electricity production always emits CO2, even if it's solar, windmills or nuclear. Yes, there is no &quot;green&quot; energy and solar panels manufacturing pollutes a lot.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the less emails you have on your mailbox, the less data you have on the cloud, the better for the environment.</p>\n<h3>More data = more pollution</h3>\n","key":".//markdown/clean-your-cloud-data.md"},{"title":"Find replacement for internet giants","category":"digital","body":"<h1>Find replacement for internet giants</h1>\n<p>G**gle, Facebook, 🍏 and any other tech monsters are harvesting data about their users and that's a bad thing for you and the environment.</p>\n<p>If something is free, there is a trick, right?
